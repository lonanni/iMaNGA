# iMaNGA: mock MaNGA galaxies based on illustrisTNG to test our theory on galaxy formation and evolution
We developed a method to generate mock galaxies from the hydro-dynamical IllustrisTNG simulations which are suited to compare
with integral field spectroscopic observation of galaxies from the SDSS-IV/MaNGA survey [Nanni et al. 2022](https://www.google.com/search?q=imanga+mnras&oq=imanga+mnras&aqs=chrome.0.69i59j69i61j69i65j69i60j69i61.1736j1j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8). 
Here we have an example of how the iMaStar code works, as well as a list of all the TNG50 galaxies post-processed and analysed in the iMaNGA project
(see [Nanni et al. 2023a](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/522/4/5479/7150712)).

If you use this code, or any of its parts, for scientific publications, please, cite [Nanni et al. 2022](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/522/4/5479/7150712).

Updates on the project will be posted on the [official website](http://www.icg.port.ac.uk/imanga/).

All the datacubes are available here: https://www.tng-project.org/data/docs/specifications/#sec5_4
The iMaNGA VAC is available at the same link. This catalogue contains all the galaxy information such as general properties, morphology, kinematics and  stellar population properties as computed by photometric and full spectral fitting codes [Nanni et al. 2023b](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14257)
