# iMaNGA: mock MaNGA galaxies based on illustrisTNG to test our theory on galaxy formation and evolution
We developed a method to generate mock galaxies from the hydro-dynamical IllustrisTNG simulations which are suited to compare
with integral field spectroscopic observation of galaxies from the SDSS-IV/MaNGA survey [Nanni et al. 2022](https://www.google.com/search?q=imanga+mnras&oq=imanga+mnras&aqs=chrome.0.69i59j69i61j69i65j69i60j69i61.1736j1j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8). 
Here we have an example of how the iMaStar code works, as well as a list of all the TNG50 galaxies post-processed and analysed in the iMaNGA project
(see [Nanni et al. 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13146)).

Updates on the project will be posted on the [official website](http://www.icg.port.ac.uk/imanga/).
